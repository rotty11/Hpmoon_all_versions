Multi-objective optimization of High-performance in heterogeneous architectures and energy-efficient. Neuroengineering application.

Development, optimization and evaluation of multi-objective classification parallel procedures for EEG signals, with parallel programming languages, such as MPI, OpenMP, and OpenCL in a High-performance Computing (HPC) environment that uses CPUs and GPUs.

We recommend to use the last version of the program and see its documentation in the subfolder "doc" before the first usage. The file "hpmoon_guide.pdf" contains the instructions necessary to use the program appropriately.
